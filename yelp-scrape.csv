The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Mike C.,"Very good food
Crab cakes were amazing gourmet
The Philly cheese was very tender and juicy"
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Michelle M.,"We've come here a few times, once during happy hour and then once during dinner service on the weekend. Both times, the food has been delicious, perfectly priced, and served with a lot of heart.
I recommend both the Philly Dip and the Steak and Baked Fries.
Happy hour menu is great!"
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Kim W.,"Came in for a Seahawks game
Pros:
Great for groups, lots of space and doesn't get too crowded which I like. Our server Andrew was amazing and really went out of his way to give us great service.
Cons:
Apparently they released a new menu the day before we came and boy if I knew I would NOT have come here. Way over priced for the type of food you get, basic bar food at restaurant prices. I was planning on coming and getting food all afternoon for the game but fries alone were almost 10$ after tax. Way way way overpriced for what food you get. My group ordered wings (which were good), nachos (alright), backyard burger (burnt) and drinks for each of us. Our bill was over $100. Somethings off if they think this will bring people in."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Eric O.,"Love the restaurant interior, staff is friendly, and drink options are plentiful. Some cons for me were pricy food items, small portions, and TVs mounted too high. I got to the eatery about 30 minutes after they opened. There were only two others in the restaurant. The bartender chatted up all the patrons and was so nice to interact with. Food came out quickly and the plates were properly warmed. I was impressed that the place had large screen TVs all around each wall of the space which was great. My only gripe was they were mounted close to the ceiling. So Monday Night Football was on the screen in front of me at the bar and I had to strain my neck a little. All in all a decent spot. I really want to rate this higher, but with the prices/portion ratio is a bit off. I will visit again when there are more patrons. Would like to see service with more people in the spot"

The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Mike H.,"Let start off by saying WOW, just WOW!! I have never had a steak salad before and i never knew what i was missing until now. I order the black and blue salad. The salad itself was large and had a good portion of steak on it. The salad was fresh and so were all the toppings. The steak was seasoned perfectly and was cooked perfectly. Medium rare to medium. The dressing the salad dressing that came with the salad brought all the flavors together and really set the salad off. I can go on record and say that this is by far one of the best salads that i have ever had. My friends order a Cajun Chicken sandwich and they said that it was delicious as well. I have passed by this place so many times I'm glad i went in and will have to go back."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Amira J.,"first of all, our server mike was so cool n sweet! authentically himself & laid back! he checked on our group often & made sure our water was refilled! it can be hard to feel welcomed by some restaurants especially if you are a black person of color so i just want to say my experience here with the service was amazing!
i met up with my folks here after work around 6. the pub is located at the end of a small lot that's shared with a gas station & a few other small stores. when you walk in it's pretty spacious inside. not really booths but lots of tables n chairs & a bar.
i ordered the large cajun chicken cesar salad 5/5: i was really excited about eating this. the portion of chicken was perfect with the amount of lettuce given. it came with parmesan, & croutons! the dressing wasn't heavy at all & i appreciated this because i was able to feel more refreshed after chowin dooown
overall i had a great experience here & would 100% recommend for happy hour & late dining.
happy hour is from 3-6, 9-close"
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Kristy R.,Second time visiting here. The outside looks a little sketchy but inside has a cool vibe! There is parking in the back in case it is completely full in the little area in front. We did not order any food at this visit but did on our last. Food is very good and service is even better! Enjoyed a couple cocktails tonight and listen to live music definitely a cool little joint. The area it's located in is not my favorite though.
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Amber Lee A.,"Good food, in a location you wouldn't expect. I drove up to meet a friend and just assumed it was a gas station. I've now been twice and all the items I have tried were very good."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Lena Y.,"Kind of a hidden gem in a strip mall within a gas station. I found this place via a quick Yelp search so my friend and I could grab dinner. It doesn't look very big from the outside, but you walk into a pretty large space with a variety of tables and seating areas. We sat ourselves as a sign instructed us to, and we were greeted by our server Mike. He was friendly, welcoming and energetic. We shared the poutine, and I got the Hellbent coconut stout and backyard burger with a side of broccoli cheddar soup. Cool that all there beers on tap are from Washington!"
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Chelsi A.,"Don't judge a book by its cover. I honestly thought it was a small old bar, and if it wasn't for my cousin recommendation I'm not sure we would have gone.
I love the atmosphere, great selection of local beers on tap and DELICIOUS pulled pork nachos; oh man!! I grew up in Renton and will know recommend this place to everyone. We will for sure be back."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Henry L.,"Came here on a Sunday night with a few friends. It's was around 8pm.
Place was pretty slow with a couple other patrons. Server was welcoming and pretty cool. We had a table by the window. There was a lot of space.
I had a cocktail called Rob Roy. It was average.
Appetizer was crab cakes. It was surprisingly a lot. Came with 2 patties the size of a bk whopper.
Entree was was seared ahi tuna. It was decent. Tuna tasted fresh. Visually, it looked pretty light. But it got me pretty full. Maybe because the crab cakes were so huge. Overall, I can't give too many points for vibes, since it was a Sunday night. Flavors for pretty average, but quality of ingredients keep it above average. I'd say if you're looking for a chill place to have a conversation, this is a good place. If you're a flavor hunter, it's pretty average."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Mike S.,"Food was good, beers were cold service was a bit slow but it all worked out. Good atmosphere, friendly staff, fair food portions. Good place to chill."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Deanna D.,"This is the 3rd time I've been here, and I love it! Very personable wait staff, great food selection, and our waiter was charismatic, and very attentive. We had the Brick Philly Dip, and the Black & Blue salad."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Leslie W.,The Brick recently changed their menu again. I miss the Cajun chicken sandwich. I only eat white meat and was glad to have this on the menu. The have since removed it. I asked the server if I could have the chicken sandwich from the old menu and he said yes. WHoooHOOOO. Unfortunately when it came out it is not the same sandwich. It is sliced chicken on a bun. This does not make a good sandwich. The pieces kept falling out of the bread. It was a horrible way to eat. The original was the reason I came to the brick repeatedly. Since that sandwich is gone I don't find anything comparable on the menu. Guess I will have to find another Cajun chicken somewhere else.
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Leslie W.,"We tried the Brick when it first opened. The had not worked out the kinks yet and it was all pretty sad. Very slow service, no vegetarian options and only 1 chicken option. Ordered just a salad and my husband had a burger. He felt the burger was tasty and the salad was decent but I don't go to restaurants just to have a salad. The menu was very lacking and extremely limited so never went back. We decided to see if the kinks were gone and tried again last week. Glad we did. The have re-vamped the menu and have a bit more variety and more chicken options. Had a chicken sandwich and my husband had a steak. He enjoyed it and I enjoyed my sandwich too. the food runner was awesome, stopping at all the tables to see if everything was okay. The female waitstaff did not give a rip that we were there. They ignored us even though the sign said seat yourself. We were in a table next to the bar and the blond bartender came over to take our order. Thankfully finally some attention. He was very pleasant and helpful. If not for him we would have left. Prices are fair, there are 8 or so tv's on the walls so always a game to watch. I recommend for the food but again the waitstaff is awful."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Stephen G.,"Our second visit to the Brick Pub. First visit a few months back was not bad.
It took at least 15 minutes for the waiter to come to our table. We ordered drinks and dinner. It took around another 10 minutes for the waiter to bring the drinks over. She was doubling as a bartender too. It took around 40 more minutes to get our food...that's almost an hour since we got there. Not acceptable. Fish from fish and chips was over fried and hard. My wife's flank steak order was sirloin tip according to her, and it was pink on the inside though she ordered it medium well.
All in all, we were pretty disappointed..."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Brad B.,"The Brick is a nice pub with great food, hiding in a gas station parking lot. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but the inside is large with lots of seating.
I loved the beer selection at the Brick. They had a whole bunch of local beers that you don't find at many other places, which that alone would keep me coming back.
The food was really good as well! I had a grilled cheese with bacon and peppers and it was awesome! I think it was about $12 which is reasonable.
They also have games out for customers to play, which is always fun when drinking beer with your friends."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Koren C.,"Best dang pork chop I've ever had!
From the outside it looks a little sketchy, but this was a VERY good restaurant! A must try!!
Great beers, good happy hour, even better food!
Thanks "" the brick"""
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Senor C.,"This place was SO good. The owner is really cool and the music is always fun.
With that said...
I have now had three bad meals in a row and I am ready to stop trying. That is big bucks I will never get back. How do you screw up a BLT? The bacon was so overcooked that it was more like burnt bacon dust than meat. The ""Philly cheese steak"" was not good and didn't even come with the advertised aioli sauce. My fries sucked and were cold. How on Earth can you make a bad cheese steak? I don't even remember what they screwed up before that but I still remember the dissapointment coupled with a 70 dollar check.
I have had everything on the menu in the past and it ALL used to be good.
Now, I am afraid to order anything.
I sure hope they fix it back to the way it was. There is nothing like this place in the highlands."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Rich L.,"Just wanted to thank the blonde haired girl and bearded guy working tonight for showing racism. We walked in approx 30 mins ago and sat down at the table next to the bar. No acknowledgement even though both of them looked straight at us. Blonde girl started cleaning one of the machines and the bearded guy just kept talking to his friends. We sat the table for 15 mins and neither of them brought a menu or said Hi to us. After I began staring at the girl wondering why we were being ignored, a white couple came in and sat at the bar. Within 30 seconds he had poured them waters and took their order. He made their drinks and we had yet to be greeted or brought a drink menu. Every person in the bar was white including the couple that came in. Coincidence??? Thank you for ruining our evening and reaffirming that asian people are not welcome at the pub."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Andrea I.,"We found this gem on Yelp, and another fantastic find it was. It has local beer on tap that my husband really liked and I had a ""Fru-Fru"" drink the Lavender Mule which was amazing. As if the great drinks weren't enough the food was just as amazing. Ordered the Pastrami Melt and it was some of the best tasting pastrami I have had.
The waitress was very informative and helpful, she knew her products and had answers to all our our questions.
This place is quite a find and it is worth the visit."
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Fanny L.,"Great place for Karaoke in West Seattle
Didn't try their food.
Always there for Karaoke night with friends, it's fun there are people from all ages/cultures... they have a long list of songs that you can choose, the DJ is amazing!
Great place to go for Karaoke"
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Carolyn J.,"Throwback Chinese food ...check!
So this place reminds me of Chinese food from the 70s and 80s. The family dinners of chow mien , fried rice and sweet and sour chicken or Mongolian beef. Its good , nothing fancy but hits the spot. So the decor is still from forty years ago , if your willing to get past that and in west seattle and needing old school Chinese food then this is the place.
The bar in the back is something else. Very popular Karaoke and hang out vibe . It gets packed. During the holidays and summer , many college kids come in and hang out and sing!!
They're keeping it real up in here!"
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Madison L.,"The food honestly wasn't that bad, but everything else was.
We went at 5:30 on a Wednesday. The place was empty. We waited for 10 minutes to be seated. Where's all the staff?
Wanted to order off the happy hour menu, but was told it's only if we order drinks, but it doesn't say anywhere that a drink purchase is necessary?
We ordered vegetable wontons as an appetizer but it came with the meal and then the vegetable egg foo young came out about 10 minutes after everything else. We had to ask the waitress (when we finally saw her) if they remembered it because she just dropped off all the food and left but no egg foo young. She said ""it's coming"" but only after we asked and only after we could get her attention.
The food is pretty average. Not bad but not the best. Pretty fair prices though and lots of options on the menu. Don't really think I feel the need to come back"
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Sheri C.,"Haven't been to the karaoke bar...yet. Three of us came in for the Chinese and there was no one there on a Friday night. Red flag! However, our food was all right. It's over breaded like crazy, but came out hot. The appetizer tray with a mixture of different things was served on a flaming hot tray with fire spewing out the middle so a little unexpected entertainment.
Yen Wor's worn out dining area needs an update, a good deep cleaning, and they like the super cheesy ""what's your Chinese zodiac"" place mats but we just wanted a place where our loud, obnoxious laughter wouldn't be minded.
Heard the phone ringing off the hook for to go/delivery orders so obviously people eat their food.
Two of us weren't in the mood to sing, but it's still on the list to go a little nuts and be even louder with the karaoke."
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Finn K.,"Terrible service. Rude staff. Dumpy atmosphere. No intentions of ever going back there. Enough said.
Please do yourself a favor and look somewhere else."
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,D Y.,"The Yen Wor is the place for great drinks , karaoke and Chinese food. Wendy is the real star here. So are you when you're up on stage being a star singing karaoke . This is a dive most sacred to Seattle and will be here long after you and I are gone ... long love the Pagoda Room and may you be lucky enough to enjoy all of the bacchanalian delights that await you inside."

Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,David S.,I know a lot of locals in West Seattle will disagree with me but I didn't really care for this place . Maybe they have really good food ? I do see people standing out in front all the time so maybe it was just the night that I was there was off .
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Dustin P.,Food is okay but the late night karaoke is the fun/best part of this place. It's also right next to a few other places to go earlier in the night.
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Joseph W.,"Incredibly rude and abysmally bad service. If you want food that literally tastes the same as other crappy Chinese places, but on top of that want to be treated subhuman, this place is for you."
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Alyssa H.,Would have given 4 stars if the DJ didn't hate Lisa loeb so much. Repeatedly skipped over the best song alive. Go somewhere else for karaoke and Lisa loeb.
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Amber B.,First and last time ordering from here. Even the potstickers were bad. The crab Rangoon was chewy... chicken chow mein smelled and tasted weird. Honey walnut prawns weren't horrible but I wouldn't order them again. We only took a few bites then wrapped it up and gave it to a homeless person.
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Christophe G.,The General Tao chicken is great and my favorite. My kids like the sweet and sour chicken. But ask for the S&S sauce on side. Not crazy about the egg rolls. Nice friendly people will take care of your take out order.
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Jade X.,"Staff seems nice, except the rude female owner who takes the angry proprietor role too far. Delivery was late and wrong, and she was completely unapologetic. Dumplings were gross, chunky dough balls with hardly any meat."
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Rhohana-Mary C.,It was my first time coming to yen wor village and I will NEVER come back to this place the bartender WENDY was Extremely Rude and Disrespectful and acted with such racist behavior it was all because I tried to pay for the nasty ass drinks she made me that were watered down I also tried to order food twice and never got anything she made a point to serve everyone else except me if you dont want to be treated like trash especially being a person of color dont bother take your hard earned money and go else where.
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Brenda B.,"Cheap drinks , great customer service, fun quirky environment and best place in W. Seattle to sing kareoke 7 nights a week ! Also every Monday open Mic night & Ladies night drink specials ! Did I mention the food :p shrimp fried rice. YUM !"
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Marilyn N.,"At first, this bar seems great but then about 11 pm. The bartender cant even hear what kind of drink you want. I was shouting and paid for a drink I didnt even want. Bar tender still made me pay for it. I would give 0 stars if I could."
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,jordan p.,"The karaoke is pretty fun, lots of participation from the crowd and the DJ is good. Personally, I wouldn't order food here unless I was starving. It can be hard to get service from the bar when you want to order drinks and the table service is pretty trash. Just a heads up, cashing out your tab takes a good five minutes. The crowd runs a bit on the older side from what I've seen, but they seem to have fun. All in all, it's alright, but wouldn't be my go to unless I really wanted to sing some karaoke and somehow couldn't get myself to Talarico's"
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Dominic A.,"I've grown up in this area. I'm not new to the yen wor. I know not to eat there, I know not to expect stellar service. I know I will get served after the regulars, and I know Wendy will butcher some obscure song on any given night.
However- for the first time in my adult life I experienced blatant racial discrimination in West Seattle by Wendy. In front of my girlfriend, and other friends I kept from causing a scene and bit my tongue- and her other bartender apologized- embarrassed for her (Wendy's) actions. She politely offered to buy me a drink, offering these words of apology ""oh, you know- that's just Wendy, you've been here before, you know how she is"". At no point should anyone need to feel as uncomfortable and I did at the yen wor."
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Jen M.,"This place was awful. I had BBQ pork and started to feel sick on my way home. Bartender was rude and forgetful. Wendy was extremely rude and offensive, it's like she has no customer service skills at all. The Apple Cup was on and one customer was screaming as if she was being killed. Trying to hold a conversation with any of my friends was impossible."
Yen Wor Village,(206) 932-1455,Melissa C.,Nothing but positive experiences here! The food is better than Safeway's. Huge menu and lots of vegetarian options. Tip well for faster service in the bar.
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Karrissa D.,"I called this evening to verify their cacio e pepe is vegetarian, and it is! yay!
I ordered the cacio e pepe and a slice of sourdough bread through uber eats. The flavor of the cacio e pepe is quite different from what I've had before, I think it's the aged cheese that really made the difference. It was delicious though! The pasta was perfectly cooked (& fresh!) and the 'sauce' still had a really good pepper flavor. The sourdough also came with a light drizzle of olive oil and salt which complemented the pasta perfectly.
Only downside was the temperature, but that's a given with delivery. Definitely looking forward to being able to visit once everything is back open, as this was my first time trying their food. I'm for sure going to order some fresh pasta for home in the future too."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Andrea O.,"Even in these challenging times (covid-19 lockdown) these guys are rocking it. They reconfigured the restaurant for to go/delivery only orders. Got my usual favorites to go and everything was amazing. Will keep supporting them during this difficult moment, consider doing the same!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Andrea O.,"I'm Italian and I'm very picky and demanding when it comes to Italian food (or food in general for that matter). Well Due is among my favorite places to get real genuine Italian food. Everything is good and authentic, my favs these days are the pasta cacio e pepe with guanciale and Tiramisù. This is a must try, it will become one of your favorites too"

Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Becca H.,"Due' Cucina is a great spot for lunch or dinner! The prices are great, the servers and atmosphere are relaxed and welcoming, and the food is amazing. My go-to order is the Traditional Bolognese Ragu with traditional spaghetti. My boyfriend orders the Aglio & Olio with healthy campanelle and adds fried tofu. Be sure to get tiramisu, sharing is an option size-wise, but you won't want to. It's to die for! We placed an order for pick-up today since the city is still under the stay-at-home order. There was no fuss and no wait to get our food. We're going to continue supporting Dué through the coronavirus pandemic and beyond. Yum!!!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Jen H.,"Thank goodness this place delivers all the way to Kirkland! I miss eating out in Seattle so I was super thankful and appreciative that we were in the delivery area.
I ordered the kale pesto campanelle and it was amazing!! I would definitely order this again. It was cooked perfectly - nice and chewy. My partner ordered the eggplant parm and he was a little disappointed with the portion size; it came in a tiny little box. He was jealous of my kale pesto pasta which I hesitantly shared with him. We shared the tiramisu at the end of our meal and it was fantastic, one of the best tiramisu I have had in awhile. Definitely planning on ordering here more while this pandemic is going on. Highly recommend!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Richard U.,"3.5 star place!
Interesting casual dining pasta place up in Cap Hill. I was looking to support local restaurants still open during the shelter at home mandate in effect and luckily they are still open for take out.
Stuff tried:
Eggplant parmesan: i am only person i know that actually craves eggplant parm. The version here is not crispy at all but it is exceedingly delicious! My only gripe is that the portion size is tiny. If you are remotely hungry i would order two servings.
Mushroom with truffle oil on healthy pasta: i am a sucker for mushroom truffle oil anything. Chose the healthy pasta which is made from some type of bean flour instead of wheat giving it a toothy consistency. The pasta has touted health benefits but the consistency might be offputting for some folks. Flavor was pretty good however
Bruschetta caprese: nice slab of grilled bread with fresh toppings. I admit that the to go version seems to have left my bruschetta a bit soggy. Eat this first next time"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Holly L.,"The pasta was very tasty! Excellent. If I had eaten on-site, I'd probably rate higher. I love that you can really taste the truffle oil in the mushroom pasta dish. The pomodoro was simple but hit the spot.
However, I ordered delivery through Yelp/Grub Hub and it was an awful wait. On yelp, it said 30-50 min wait time. However I waited 1.5 hours or 40 mins to 1 hour more wait time than I expected. I was tired and hadn't eaten for more than 9 hours so I picked the place that could be the least amount of wait. The restaurant blamed the grub hub driver, and when I called grub hub they weren't taking calls. After my 3rd call to grub hub, they also blamed the driver and gave me a lousy 10% discount for my next purchase.
I'd probably eat here again but NEVER use delivery."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Marie B.,"I love pasta and have been to just about every Italian spot in Seattle. Handmade pasta, I'm there! Pasta in a casual setting, even better! Most often though, I don't have access to the likes of Il Corvo, Pasta Casalinga, G.H. Pasta, Ristorante Machiavelli, Tavolata, or La Vita e Bella because I currently don't work in Seattle.
However, the very first Yelper I ever met is credited for the recommendation to Due' Cucina Italiana *Bryan K* Clearly, I had been under a rock and late to the pasta bowl party at this popular Capitol Hill/Broadway spot. I've interacted with the two brothers than run DCI, great charismatic business owners. Brilliant concept and business hours until 2200! Great counter staff and efficient kitchen crew. A variety of seating are available whether dining solo, pairs or larger groups. Just remember to kindly bus your table at the end!
My first visit was back in December 2018 (been open since October 2016!) and have been back so many times that honestly I've lost count. This is a long overdue Yelp review as I just had a custom pasta bowl for dunch/linner hours ago (1/27/20).
Assorted fresh pasta that's crafted on site. Your pasta bowl is customized by selecting type of pasta, sauce, and other ingredients from the giant wall signage. Order and pay at the counter, then find a place to sit if dining onsite. There's also brisk takeout and delivery traffic.
In about 15-20 minutes your name is called or check the status on the order monitor. I like to admire my pasta bowl and then dig in while nice and hot. Feeling raveneous, one can easily polish off a bowl. Most often, I have tasty leftovers for another meal.
Another item I've had often (but not today) is their delicious tiramisu. Enough to share, or not!
So thank you Bryan K, Due' Cucina Italiana has become one of my regular spots.
High quality, delicious, affordable, satisfying, highly recommended!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Theresa L.,Ordered from here for the first time last night. Had delivered and dropped at the front door. Everything was timely manor and tasted great! Can't wait to try more
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Julia L.,"Had a lovely lunch here recently! The place is modern, clean, well lit (large windows) with plenty of open seating. Remember to seat yourself & bus your own table. My group tried a variety of the sauces...
- traditional bolognese: rich, hearty, filling
- cacio & pepe: the cheese flavor was very sharp and strong, delicious but a bit too much for me
- amatriciana: lots of tomato flavors + smokey, savory goodness in the form of guanciale (cured pork cheek)
- mushroom & white truffle oil: creamy, thick, but not too heavy. Wonder, well balanced flavors between the mushroom and truffle oil (personal favorite out of the 4 sauces)
The pastas were all fresh and perfectly al dente (firm, chewy). Personally enjoyed the rigatoni and ca campanelle best. Would recommend and come back again!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Pauli D.,"Fresh pasta + mushroom sauce =

Every time I go to @duecucina I become more and more of a fan. It's a place that has definitely grown on me. The pastas are light, more my style for lunch, and very very fresh!

My favorite at the moment would be the mushroom sauce. Simple and yet the umami really shines through. What do you get here?"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Pauli D.,"Who knew such a cute little pasta shop could be found in cap hill? The sauces are pretty light and the noodles are cooked just enough to still have that bite where it sticks to your teeth. You won't feel heavy with cheese or sleepy from too many carbs. You order first then pick up your food in the back from the kitchen. It's bus yourself when you are finished here, they have water in the back and utensils available on the table.
The tiramisu is also very very nice and I usually don't even like tiramisu so a round of applause for that. We need to come back and try more dishes because for the low price you get a great amount of food."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Edward A.,"Friendly staff, in a way. I was told the order line starts near the entrance. I thought i had to order at the food pickup area. Oops.
I had eggplant parmesan. Pretty tasty little appetizer dish. My wife had the only pasta dish that was rated high on the al dente-ish. Those noodles were rather undercooked. Felt like i was eating them raw. But i guess thats what it is by definition? I can definitely see the appeal."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Yvonne Yiyao X.,"Can't believe it took me so long to find this place. Friendly service. Reasonably priced. Food is fast and fresh. Delicious sauce. Pasta is al dente. I loved both pasta dishes and the tiramisu. I see their take out orders coming out rapidly. The store is not super busy or overwhelming. The owner actually cares about his business and was cleaning up here and there. The kitchen is bright and clean - always a good thing to be able to see the kitchen.
Four stars but only because of my love to Il Corvo. This is a place I'll certainly come back soon."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Cristina G.,"I have ordered this twice to be delivered to my office using uber eats. This is the best italian pasta I have eaten in Seattle with the exception of Barolo. The pasta is definitely made freshly from scratch and cooked perfectly al dente chewy.
My favorite dish is the mushroom and truffle oil pasta The first time, i went with another reviewer's suggestion and added pork. I decided I liked it better without pork since pork was flavorful but a little greasy.
Last time I ordered a pasta with another type of ragu and it was also great but needing cheese. Make sure you request extra cheese if you order this pasta.
I would pass on ordering any of the breads."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Brianna F.,"We came here on a Thursday evening for a double date to celebrate a couple birthdays and it was packed! Due Cucina Italiana is an order-upon-entry, seat-yourself, and bus-your-own-table establishment. Luckily our friends had arrived earlier than us and were able to snag a table.
The ordering steps are as follows: choose a sauce, choose a pasta, order add-ons or drinks if wanted, sit and watch the screen until your order is ready.
Holy guacamole this place is good! Although the rest of my party ordered the bolognese ragu, I decided on the mushroom and white truffle oil sauce with campanelle pasta and pork sausage. The wait for our food was about 15 minutes, but the food is freshly prepared after your order is placed. The portions are extremely generous for the price, and it's very obvious that the pasta is fresh and perfectly al dente.
I will definitely be back to try the other sauce and pasta options. AND DESSERTS! ;)"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Derek H.,"AMBIANCE
I'm a huge fan of white tile on white grout walls because it really brightens up the place. The servers are super friendly and nice. Food came out in less than ten minutes. It's cool to see all the pasta being made behind the counter. The place is really clean.
FOOD
We went with the Mushroom and White Truffle Oil with Pork Sausage and the Traditional Bolognese both with their recommended pastas. You could definitely taste the freshness of the pasta (not that I had any doubt because they literally make it behind the counter). The noodles had a great bounce, while still remaining a perfect al dente.
The sauces were great, but honestly just didn't fit my preferred palette. Completely a personal thing. The wine hints in the bolognese were too pronounced for my liking. I prefer a meatier and drier bolognese. It was hard to taste the truffle in the other dish. Then again it's $13, you can't expect much. I would have preferred more cream, but again, it's just personal preference!
OVERALL
Great vibe, I love being able to choose different sauces and noodles. I'd come back if I was in the area for a different dish."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Monica L.,"I'm not a pasta lover whatsoever. I eat pasta maybe once or twice a year. But I about licked my plate and my friend's plate. Holy moly. I couldn't get enough of my lasagna and her campanelle.
The staff is super friendly too. You pick up your food, grab your own water, and bus your own table. You have to go up to the counter to order too. There's no waiter but nobody cares because the pasta is out of this world.
It's too bad I don't live right above the building. I'm now a total convert."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Tracy C.,This was one of the most highly rated restaurants in Capitol Hill so I had very high expectations but I was disappointed. I got the traditional bolognese and I was expecting it to have lots of sauce and flavour but the toppings tasted off and it was too dry. My pasta also took a long time to prepare compared to my friends so I thought it would be super fresh but it wasn't at all. I recommend skipping this restaurant if you're looking for Italian food.
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Jen L.,"My biggest complaint is that our pastas were NOT hot. It was a warm, but not close to hot! Lasagna was hot. We were waiting at the counter before they even called my name since I saw we were next up.
- Mushroom and white truffle with added pork sausage. This was our favorite. My sister's bowl had more sauce than ours, which I think is better as ours was a bit dry. What's with the inconsistency?
-Smoked salmon spaghetti: as you can see from my photo we had very little salmon compared to other customers' photos and the restaurant website's photos. WTH?! It was mostly noodles with a few piece of salmon and a pile of greens. Totally not what everyone else's pics look like.
- Lasagna Bolognese: I've definitely had better. Would probably choose the regular bolognese pasta over this.
- bell pepper bruschetta: too salty, but a nice change from a regular caprese
- tiramisu: delicious!
Pros: fresh pastas are cooked to perfection. Price is on point.
They do not take reservations. You order at the cashier, and then wait for them to call your name. It's really loud inside so there's board that tells you when they are ready for you to come up to the counter to get your food to carry back to your table. And the bowls/plates are heavy. You have to get your own water in the back. Also you are required to bus your own table. So what exactly did I add a tip for? I guess I should have read the other reviews. Maybe that's how they keep their prices reasonable. I was so excited to come here after being in Italy 1 month ago, and chose this restaurant for a night out with friends. With the inconsistency of salmon portion (and mushroom sauce), and failure of the proper temp of the pasta, I feel disappointed."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Melody Y.,"Oh my goodness the food is absolutely incredible here! The pasta is fresh, cooked to al dante perfection, and tasted amazing. I love how they offer sublime quality Italian dishes in a casual environment.
Being from Vancouver, I never thought there'd be a place like this. Wanting Italian food always means paying significantly more for a fine dining experience. Not only is Due Cucina super casual, but the prices are also affordable as well. I highly recommend adding a poached egg to your pasta! Elevates the experience to a whole other level."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,chara c.,"Disappointing. The pasta dough is homemade but machine-worked and the gluten is clearly not worked long enough because it has no chew or ""bite"" to it. My plate of pasta was also undercooked and tough. The sauces were mostly good, except the Amatriciana was a too salty and way too much cheese it was overpowering. It was more casual than expected but that was just fine, as orders were at the front and you picked up your own food. Came out pretty quickly and it wasnt too busy during weekday lunch."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Sarah M.,"Yummy, with big portions. Had takeout during the Covid epidemic, and during this time they are offering 20% off to go orders -- even for wine. I can only imagine how it would be even better for a sit down visit and can't wait for the chance to go back during better times."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Dan T.,"We ordered takeout yesterday due to the quarantine of the city. The food was absolutely delicious. Some of the best Italian food we have ever had and so welcome during these challenging times. Chef Antolin is the best at his craft.
We will definitely be calling in another order soon. For everyone who wants a truly first class meal please support this restaurant and their staff.
Thank you for making our dinner and evening so enjoyable at home."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Mike V.,"Why are these restaurants only in Seattle?
It's as if all these great chefs slaved away in the industry for years, and one day woke up and said, you know what? I'm going to buy a small place, house, bottom floor of a building with three chiropractic offices, and just run my own small kitchen where I can float casually between the pan my guests tables, regaling them with stories of my cooking career and adventures, all the while wowing them with absolutely incredible dishes.
What Zouave is for Italian with a hint of southern French flair, Pomodoro is for Italian with a decidedly Spanish/Mediterranean coastline lean.
The chef knocks it out of the park every time we go here, and the service in largely impeccable, but more so when the chef is hanging around your table.
Outside of traveling abroad, we rarely do a full bottle of wine at dinner in the US, as dinners are often so rushed. Not here. And we always take the chefs recommendation on a bottle once we've decided which of his incredible meals we will take on for the evening.
My personal favorites are the Capellini with the fresh dungeness crab (insanely good) and the puttanesca with prawns. And yes, you should absolutely take the chefs recommended additional spice from his special habanero olive oil that you've read about, or if you're lucky and he has it, his secret truffle oil.
We have two places we go every week or two in Seattle, Canon for drinks and dinner, and Pomodoro for the slightly early dinner on weekends, especially rainy ones where you want nothing more than comfort food, smiles and great red wine."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,David P.,"Honestly, I think Pomodoro is the best Italian restaurant in Seattle. I've been to fancier places in Seattle, to cheaper places, but the food and people at Pomodoro are second to none.
I used to live in Boston where I was lucky to have experienced authentic Italian food in the North End area of the city. Being able to get home-y Italian food is one of the things I miss the most about Boston and Pomodoro fills that void for me.
The food is no frills, just good food. The owners and staff are genuine and warm. We would highly recommend checking out Pomodoro!"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Chris A.,"A chef that's cooked for the King of Spain? Sign me up... xD
I've been living in Seattle for almost 10 years and Pomodoro continues to be one of my go to spots for visitors and for when I want to treat myself! Prices are very reasonable and the food and service is amazing.
Pomodoro is an awesome mixture of Spanish Basque and Italian. I've been numerous times, always ordered something new, and have always enjoyed my meal. Also can someone figure out what is in that avocado pesto that is brought to every table? Its so GOOD! xD."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Thao N.,"First of all, happy birthday to one of my best friend, Jordan!!!
She's the reason why we discovered this restaurant since I never have a reason to be around this Eastlake neighborhood. The restaurant is super cute, small, and intimate, good thing we had a reservation. Food is great, my angel hair pasta just melts in my mouth. I ordered no shrimp because I don't eat seafood and they offered to replace it with mushrooms, wasn't even expecting a replacement. Everybody's food looked so good too, it was freshly made as you can see the hot steam coming in the air while everybody is eating. Service was excellent considering we did came in a large group. They even came outside to take a group photo for us which you already know, it's time consuming when it's all girls xD
There's unlimited bread as appetizers, be careful or you might actually get too full before your entree comes out. Love this place, nice enough for date nights/special occasions and cozy enough if you casually just want some good Italian food for dinner. I hate cooking, good thing I didn't have to last night.
Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Nicole A.,"I was scrambling to find a place for dinner for 5 people on a Friday night, and luckily Pomodoro came the the rescue! It's a smaller restaurant that has a very intimate vibe with dim lighting and a partially open kitchen.
To start we shared two tapas: the ravioli with hummus and truffle, and the calamari. Of the two, I preferred the calamari. The squid tasted fresh and it was sautéed squid rather than breaded and deep fried squid, which was a pleasant change. In comparison the ravioli was a bit too rich and heavy.
For my entree I opted for the paella and I was happy with my choice! The amount of seafood was abundant and the presentation was pretty. I also enjoyed the seasonings and it was cooked well. The only suggestion I would have would be to get a bit more of a crispy layer in the skillet. The rice seemed like it was cooked into a larger batch and then served in the skillet they brought me, so I was missing the slightly crunchy and smoky bits I love in paella. After a while, the texture can be a bit one-note without them."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Janhavi B.,"Pomodoro is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in Seattle. There are fancier ones, but the food and service here are is unparalleled. I would say that Pomodoro is pricier than some others (e.g. Ristorante Machiavelli) but it more than makes up with the personal touch and the fact that you can get a table way more easily! Located on the relatively quiet Eastlake Avenue - it's almost easy to miss, but their handmade pastas, and dessert (tiramisu and creme brulee) are a must-try. Almost every pasta and special I have tried so far has been delicious so I can't recommend anything specific but highlight recommend a visit here! With 1 entree per person, a dessert and a bottle of wine, it may end up costing you close to $40-50 a pop."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Jordan N.,"I've been here two times already and both times have been amazing! They have free parking behind the restaurant and can make​ reservations online for big parties in advance.
Both times I ordered the Linguine alla Carbonara con Pancetta, which has pork belly and ​light cream. It was very delicious and satisfying to my stomach! Normally I feel so bloated after eating pasta but I ate the whole damn thing! I also had a malbec (red wine) to complement my pasta. There's also a bread appetizer served with some cilantro butter, so yummy!
Last night I came here for my birthday dinner and the staff brought out a tiramisu cake with a candle. The cake was rich in coffee flavor. The staff was also patient with our large party and even split up our checks and took a picture for us!
I love coming here and would love to try new things on their menu when I have another chance. Highly recommended to those who love Italian and Spanish dishes."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Jacqueline H.,"Came here for a friend's birthday and had a great meal! The restaurant is in a quiet area of Eastlake and is pretty low key. The chef walks around and takes your order and provides some great recommendations. We ordered the portobello mushrooms and octopus as appetizers. Both were delicious! They also bring you bread that comes with a side of pesto - love when Italian restaurants give pesto instead of bread or olive oil!
For the entrees, we ordered the Gnocchi con Salsiccia e Funghi, paella, and Capellini al Aglio con Polpa di Grancio e Tartufo. The paella was really good and came with a good variety of seafood (calamari, mussels, shrimp) and wasn't overly greasy. The capellini was delicious! I loved the crab meat and truffle oil. The gnocchi was good as well, but my least favorite out of the 3. Additionally we tried their tiramisu and it was amazing! Overall, a great Italian restaurant that is super low key but has delicious food. Highly recommend!"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Heidi L.,"I was looking for a nice date night spot for my boyfriend and I since we were craving Italian food for our anniversary. The restaurant wasn't too busy at the time we came in. The chef, himself stopped by our table asking how our food was, he then recommended a spicy oil that would go well with my special pasta. I love spicy food so that was a pleasant experience and it complimented the food well. Both the pasta dishes were filled with flavor and just danced in our taste pallet. It had us talking about it for the rest of the evening haha. I would definitely comeback for another date night!"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Lynden L.,"My dining experience at Pomodoro was as a part of a large-party. For those interested in making a large party reservation, they will typically require you to book a time earlier than their normal dinner hours and charge a late/overtime fee if your group shows up late or stays beyond the allocated time.
The service was very friendly throughout the evening and as they were prepared for our party, servers were very prompt as well. They quickly took everyone's individual pasta orders as they sat down and served the caesar salad shortly after. The dressing on the caesar was very flavorful and was not too salty or heavy. It did seem like the lettuce had been sitting in the dressing for a while though-- this might not be an issue with a regular dining experience.
I ordered the Penne alla Vodka, which I believe was the best dish out of the pre-selected options we were given. It was the perfect balance between creamy and tangy. There could've been a bit more sausage or veggies to mix up the texture though. I also had a bite of the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto con Linguine pasta, which was alright, but felt like it was missing a certain 'oomph'. Perhaps some extra spice or citrus (lemon squeeze?) would really brighten it up. The prawns served with the dish were very plump and fresh though!
The tiramisu was average-- we did notice that each piece seemed to have a different flavor profile (more chocolatey, more alcoholic, more coffee) so there was a lack of consistency but the taste was fine."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Jun Li Z.,"Came here on a date in October 2018. The pasta dishes are great and I recall the service was really good. I recommend coming here on dates or with a friend. The atmosphere is quite chill, low lighting which can be romantic or hard for your partner to see the menu ;)"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Amanda I.,"I came to Pomodoro the night after an interview to reward myself and unwind a bit. I ordered the Dungeness crab angel hair pasta special and loved it. Though it was pricey, there was a good amount of crab. I believe it also had some black truffles which added great flavor to the simple butter garlic sauce. They also offer a spicy sauce to drizzle on top and I would highly recommend it. It is a bit spicy so maybe ask to try a little on the side first.
For dessert I got the creme brûlée. This is perhaps one of my favorite dessert dishes so I couldn't resist. I was somewhat disappointed. Instead of the creamy center it usually has, this one was much firmer. The flavor was good but the texture was certainly off. The top tasted like a toasted marshmallow which, again, is not quite what one typically looks for in a creme brûlée. But it was good and I ate it up. However for $9 it is definitely not worth the price.
Service here is really good. The owner is very friendly and chatted to me a little about my trip to Seattle. Other employees were very efficient and friendly as well. The check did feel a little rushed at the end but otherwise the service was great!
If you're looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion this would be a really good option. The food is a little pricier but it is delicious. The ambiance creates a more upscale feel and the service is on point."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Sloan C.,"Went there last Friday night. Although I was late for my reservation, they were nice enough to find a table for me and my friend. Food was great. Ordered linguine with cream and anise sauce and shrimp. The sauce was balanced - flavorful yet not too heavy. The pasta was topped with some grapes, which I found interesting. I also ordered ab octopus side and it was soooo tender. Would definitely come back again to try other items from the menu!"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Annalise W.,"Love this place. Perfect little neighborhood Italian restaurant. Ideal for date nights, celebrating, or if you're just craving some delicious Italian food. Romantic, intimate, and homey vibe.
Portion sizes are generous and food is always consistently delicious. I love their caesar salad. I always get the same entree, the chicken breast with gorgonzola sauce and pasta with red sauce. It's absolutely amazing! Chicken is tender and juicy. I always have a hard time deciding if I want a creamy white sauce or a zesty tomato sauce and I love this dish because I get the best of both worlds. The chicken is covered in a creamy gorgonzola and the pasta is in a light tomato sauce. Portion size is very generous. They also have a house made chili oil that you can ask for on your pasta. It's too spicy for me, but if you love some heat I recommend. I have also ordered the carbonara, which I recommend. I also highly recommend the tiramisu.
Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city! There is also a free covered parking garage that is super convenient."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Alex O.,"Best fettuccine Alfredo hands down. At least for me. I don't know why but it has such an interesting taste. Different from all the other Alfredo dishes I've had. I just want to eat more and more. It has a Spanish twist to it. If you order it's Polla al Jerez. The tiramisu is also heavenly. I need to stop trying the other desserts and just stick with this one.
The snow crab pasta is also exceptionally good. I need to get this one again. If only I could eat pasta everyday."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Artemis L.,"I am giving this restaurant five stars despite a couple of unsettling experiences with our waiter. The food is just that good.
My husband took me out to dinner at Pomodoro last night to celebrate my birthday. It is a lovely little restaurant, with creative lighting (red circle lights, tiny twinkling white lights, and warm yellowish-white lights), and crisp white tablecloths.
I had the tomato cream soup, the paella, and I split the dungeness crab linguine with my husband. My husband also had the pork pancetta. My husband is characteristially very unenthusiastic, so when I asked him how his food was and he said ""good"" (he says ""okay"" 95%+ of the time that I ask him this question), I knew that the food was an unusually special experience for him, too!
My food was absolutely outstanding, probably among the top ten meals I've ever eaten. The chef had a lovely long blurb included in the menu about his love for cooking, a few of his famous customers, and his experience as a chef. While I enjoyed reading this blurb, I definitely judged the food on my actual experience of eating it, which was heavenly.
We also ordered a bottle of the Cava Mont Marcal wine. I enthusiastically recommend this wine. It was outstanding.
Our waiter has a very genteel manner, but his memory and attentiveness are unfortunately severely lacking. We arrived fairly late, just after 9pm, and perhaps he'd had a long and busy night before we arrived. He also appeared to be pushing 90 years old.
He smiled a lot and he seemed like he was trying his best, but he basically ignored us for the middle half of our meal. My husband had to literally get up out of his chair three times to go up to him when we needed something. He was just in his own world (also I think partially closing the restaurant, but we just couldn't get his attention for several minutes on end after several tries).
He was respectful and sweet when he did get to us, however, he also brought up four very serious and upsetting topics (communism, genocide, global warming, and immigration), all of which I deeply care about, however, I would prefer very much to focus on lighter, more pleasant conversational topics while eating a celebratory birthday dinner. It was an odd experience - I must say I've actually never had a waiter bring up such topics when dining out.
At the start of our meal, I informed the waiter that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition which gluten can aggravate terribly. I was happy to see that there are gluten-free options for many of the dishes, which I requested. He seemed to really listen to that, which is important to me, and I did not flare with my condition after eating my meal.
However, at the end of the night, he brought me out a surprise piece of tiramisu with a flaming birthday candle on it. He had a huge smile on his face and he looked so excited, and I was delighted! However, when he put the piece of tiramisu in front of me I had a scared feeling for a second and asked him, ""Is this gluten-free?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""I can't eat it then, can you please take it away?"" He said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" I said, ""Yes, you did know, because I told you at the beginning of the meal that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition."" He said again, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" To be honest, the apology seemed genuine. He seems like a nice person. But it's a little scary that he completely forgot something that could have caused me serious pain.
But then he said, ""well, your husband can eat it then."" I said, ""My husband will not be eating birthday cake in front of me on my birthday that I am not able to eat."" He offered me Spumoni or coffee on the house. I declined.
I feel like he was really trying to make things right, I think he just wasn't getting it. I got upset and asked my husband to pay for our meals and asked my husband to leave a 20% tip to be polite (I usually tip between 23% - 27%). I left the restaurant and waited for my husband in the car while he paid. I feel like the waiter does embody the spirit of service that I look for when I dine out, despite the unsettling errors on his part.
Recommended, but if you are gluten-free maybe double-check more than you usually would. This food is absolutely stunning."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Jacey H.,"Yes, yes, yes. Great service, cozy little atmosphere. Not pretentious. Everything was perfect."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Michael G.,"Excellent all around.
We came on a Friday night. Many open tables, but they were committed to upcoming diners, so we were seated at the bar. Our good luck since we got to chat up many people behind the bar.
Interesting menu choices, tapas, full dishes, that start traditional Italian but also have a Spanish twist to many items.
We had veal marsala and vodka penne. The marsala was particularly adventurous. Great wine by the glass choices.
Tiramisu is a have-to-have. Eastlake should be proud to have this in their neighborhood!"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,John W.,"What a nice find, downtown Seattle -
I wish local-to-me Italian restaurants could pull off the kind of affordable home-made Italian that this place does, right in downtown Seattle, no less.
If I was local, I'd be coming here quite often - I don't know how they make Italian this low of price, and this high of quality. I would have expected to pay more. Heck, in my town, homemade Italian of any kind is starting at over $20 a plate.
This place is comparable in price to Old Spaghetti Factory and Olive Garden (but obviously is worlds better)."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Ken H.,"I love the food. Second to none
The customer service is terrible
Been along time customer and the service has plumbed. They used to be warm and welcoming but not anymore
The owner is wonderful and I wish her the best but the the staff is uninviting, rude and cold.
If you go here it's for the food only."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Ken H.,"This is a treasured establishment that always delivers. It is and shall remain a Seattle favorite.
It is small and quaint and it fills up very quickly.
If you go, go when it opens because it will be full by the time you leave.
Spaghetti and Meatballs are amazing and the veal dishes are out of this world.
They also have a great Caesar salad that you can get the WHITE SPANISH ANCHOVIES with and its worth it.
Friendly, but not always warm and if busy, a feeling of being rushed.
Still, a great spot for good food."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Zachariah H.,"I've been to Machiavelli 3 or 4 times now but my opinion of it goes down each time. While the food + price is 5 stars, the wait time & experience makes me feel miserable. Here's my most recent (Tuesday night!) experience:
I arrive and meet two of my friends who are sitting on a bench in the entry hall. Our 4th friend is running late so we can't put our name down yet. This entry hall is maybe 4 feet wide with a small bench & people streaming in and out past the small horde of people waiting. Claustrophobic. After 10 minutes or so, some seats open up in the slightly less crowded bar area. We sit and it's bearable but not like we actually get anything to drink since a) no one comes by to take such an order & b) we're here to eat Italian food not drink shitty alcohol. The clincher is that after our 4th arrives, I have to jostle for position with the other prospective diners as we flag down a harried receptionist who exasperatedly writes our names on the wait list. After 20 minutes, we're finally ready to begin waiting for a table.
Many other restaurants in Capitol Hill also have bad wait times but they usually also:
- Take a phone number & call/text when the table is ready.
Or
- Let you put your name down before your whole party is there."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Prag R.,"Incredibly LONG wait time. We waited for 2 hours to get a table last night. Wish they accepted phone reservations, wonder how this never bothered them as many Yelpers have given the same feedback!
FOOD-
While waiting for the table, we hung around the bar and ordered few drinks and small plates. They were okay. We ordered the main course as soon as we got seated. The bread was good, soft and fresh. Its free for the first time and you pay on from the second order. We got the Spinach Ravioli and my Veal Saltimbocca and they both were so yummy! Worth the wait time definitely."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Khanh N.,"I am sooo glad I found this cute little place! Shoutout to my boyfriend for finding it on his Yelp search!
This cute little place was packed when we got there around 8pm on a Friday night. We put or name down (they quoted as an hour) and went elsewhere for a drink because the bar area was packed as well. The layout of the restaurant is a bit odd and a little difficult to get in and out with people wait on the bench but I think it adds to its charm. Just be prepared to wait but there are tons of places around to grab a drink or explore :)
We came back an hour later. And they called two names that didn't show and then we were up! They quoted us time perfectly. Going into the restaurant area you can see why it's such a long wait. I think I counted about 14 tables for the entire restaurant.
We sat down. Got bread. We ordered drinks. Drinks came so fast. We got a half carafe of red wine. And then we ordered. And our food came. It was such fast and great service! We felt cared for but also didn't feel like they were bothering us all the time. The bread is from Macrina bakery and it was delish! Our pastas that we got were UNREAL. Such good portions sizes and DELICIOUS.
Best part of this was that it was $44 before tip and we were stuffed and had leftovers. That's definitely a STEAL!!
Probably are new go to date night spot. Seriously love this place."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Nancy W.,"I haven't been here for a few years but still love the place. Very small venue and they don't take reservations so either get there early or plan on a wait. We were here on a Friday night and got to the restaurant about 5:15 and they were just about full, even after opening at 5. As an appetizer we ordered the Bresaola Alla Valtinellese which is cured beef, olive oil and lemon topped with arugula and shaved parmesan cheese. My friend ordered the fettuccine carbonara and I ordered the lasagna bolognese. Both were excellent, although I would have liked to have had more bolognese sauce. Noticed that in between some of the layers of lasagna there was nothing but pasta on top of pasta. Wine was nothing exceptional. Didn't order dessert but now wish I had as they featured a chocolate mousse tiramisu. Big regret there. Small cozy bar with good music."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Danielle D.,"TLDR
I'm Italian and from NY--my standards for Italian food are high.
Seattle has a way of taking any type of soul food & making it unapproachable, so when searching through all of the restaurants I was reluctant.
I was given a few Italian restaurant suggestions, but they all were an abrupt ""no"". Through my own search, I found Machievelli. I was hesitant at first--bc yelp photos make it seem like a pizza shop--but
Took a chance.
I was blown away.
There are TWO rooms, a bar area /waiting room and a romantically lit dining room.
Tiny, but the feel and smell brought back NY memories.
I was seated with bread. Thank goodness. Put away 3 plates myself.
Gave them additional tests & ordered the traditional antipast, eggplant parm, & tiramisu.
WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!
They are a restaurant I will forever go to --and send people to!
Bring cash trust me.
Oh man I loved this restaurant."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Janhavi B.,"My new go-to for a casual Italian dine-out experience. Authentic, delicious and not unnecessarily expensive (unlike most Italian joints in town). We were 3 people and shared the red pepper penne with shrimp, the carbonara and a half-carafe of wine! We ended up paying about $25 a pop. You can expect a long wait given its location in Capitol Hill but you can wait with a drink in the bar area and should get in within 30- 45 minutes. All in all - highly recommend for an amazing Italian fare!"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Isaiah G.,A friend referred me here. We we're in Seattle and our hotel was only two blocks away. We decided to come here for valentines. I can't really judge the wait based on going on the busiest holiday in the year. The is a small but really cute restaurant. As soon as you walk in there's a bench you can sit at if you need to wait. There's a good size bar with tables to the right. Up two steps is the hostess. Once you go to what is considered the second floor it's a small restaurant. I almost felt like I was in a home. The bread and oil they gave with the bread was really good. I ordered a Cesar salad that was pretty good too. My husband ordered your typical spaghetti and meat balls. To my surprise it was pretty authentic and very delicious. I ordered pasta with a white sauce and prawns. My dish was just as good if not better. The service was very good and professional. I would definitely be returning.
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Jenny C.,"It has been a long time since I've been here and on a Friday night there was about a 45 minute wait. The good thing about their waitlist is, if you miss your spot they'll put you in line for the next table so it is not like you have to wait all over again.
I don't really enjoy the atmosphere of this place and that's the main reason for me not coming back. It's crowded and loud and not in the least bit romantic if you're looking to come here for a date. That being said, I did enjoy the food. The Caesar salad had a good dressing and the lettuce was fresh and crisp. I loved my linguine vongole and that was definitely the better of the two pasta dishes but I think I would be smart and just get takeout next time.
There is a 5% cash discount so bring some cash if you would like to save a little money."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Jenny C.,"Machiavelli is a good basic Italian place that is very popular with the locals. There is almost always a wait but we showed up after 8pm on the Saturday and only waited 20 minutes so that was reasonable. The server promptly brought us ice water and Columbia City bread. The bread was definitely fresh with a soft interior and a chewy crust. The dipping sauce is unique too and sold in bottles for $6.50. The wines by the glass were reasonably priced at $7.50-$8.50 per glass.
We ordered the Linguine alle Vongole $12.95 and the Fettucine Carbonara $13.95. My favorite was the linguine. The linguine had a very flavorful spicy garlic red sauce. On the other hand, the carbonara sauce lacked salt despite the bacon and the pasta was served lukewarm which detracted from our enjoyment of it. Oddly enough, the carbonara had a smaller portion size too compared to the linguine despite being the pricier entree.
Two options were available for dessert tonight: housemade tiramisu or vanilla cheesecake. We opted for the tiramisu and were not disappointed. The ladyfingers were soaked with the perfect amount of liquid and had a good coffee flavor without being soggy. The whipped mascarpone on top was a nice touch. Normally tiramisu is layers of mascarpone and ladyfingers alternating but Machiavelli does it differently and I like how there is less cream than usual.
This is a solid place and service was good so we will definitely be back but skipping the carbonara."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Dione L.,"Me and my boyfriend always walk by this restaurant and have been dying to go. We finally made it over here and literally probably MY FAVORITE italian spot in seattle.
The staff/ service was fantastic. The restaurant was super cozy and fun. The food is super reasonable and portions were good.
The pasta was super fresh i got the spaghetti with garlic and olive oil. Super light and good flavors. I'm going to have dreams about this pasta no joke!
10/10 come"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Carol B.,"Honestly, how can you not love this place. It's the perfect place for authentic Italian food and it's so cheap! We've tried so many different dishes here and love each and every one. If I had to make one recommendation, it would be to try the linguine and clams. Don't forget a wine pairing!
Full warning, there's essentially no parking in this area of capitol hill so you should walk or take a ride share. There's almost always a wait, so plan accordingly. The inside is quite small which means it gets loud quickly, but again it's all worth it. We can't stay away"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Victoria H.,"Machiavelli was amazing! It is truly a little Italian treasure on Capitol Hill! I have lived in the neighborhood for a while, but recently decided to try it out and so glad I did!
The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five was the LONG wait. Otherwise, it's a fantastic restaurant! The servers and hostess were all really nice and the food is DELICIOUS. It was definitely some of the greatest Italian food that I have had in Seattle! I really enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant as well. Very hip and casual.
Myself and my friend both had the Chicken Parmigiana and we loved it! It was cooked to perfection and had a layer of sauce over it that was amazing! The cheese melted on top was delicious as well, and to top it off the ground parmesan cheese on top of it made it everything! The spaghetti that came as a sodr dish was delicious as well!
For dessert, I had their in-house made vanilla bean cheesecake, which was phenomenal. It had a Graham cracker crust that just melts in your mouth. One of the best tasting cheesecakes I have ever had!
I definitely enjoyed Machiavelli and I will be returning. :) Please note, if you go on a weekend night, please be prepared to wait a while. However, your wait will be worth it! :)"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Nita L.,"TLDR: Amazing food, cheap prices, ridiculously long wait times for both food and a table.
Food: You get a free serving of bread for the table which was fresh and soft, also much needed because the wait for food was really long. We ordered a half carafe of the house wine to drink, the spinach ravioli - which was creamy and well cooked and my ultimate favorite- The chicken liver lasagne. The chicken liver lasagne takes 25 mins to cook and every bite of it is well worth the wait.
Ambience & Service: This is a cozy restaurant with limited seating so the wait times here are incredibly long. I had to wait for more than an hour to get a table for 2. They don't accept phone reservations either. You can chill at the bar while you wait.
Cost: This is where this restaurant won me over. Cost us just 46$ for a dinner for two people that included 2 glasses of wine per person and 2 entrees. This is a very decent price to pay for the quality of food you get here.
My only complaint is the wait times involved. Else this place is awesome!"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Michael G.,"Trattoria atmosphere, large menu, passable service in a very busy location. Tight tables make for a loud atmosphere.
Extensive menu. We had the eggplant and tortellini with creme sauce, both were spot on. There are so many Italian joints in this general area, this is a good choice for the price. Carafe wine was decent.
We will return."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Jenn N.,"We had to wait 1hr, but the food was really worth it.
The Caesar salad with white anchovies was EXCELLENT. Probably the best salad I've ever had, thought it may or may not have been caused by the 1hr wait time. Anyway, the white anchovy add on is a must.
For the main course, I got the chicken liver lasagna. It was delicious, but I also like eating organs (fair warning for those who don't like eating organs normally and want to see if they'd like it. You won't because the distinct flavor was definitely still there)."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Tom B.,"I've eaten here 18 years now. Moved away, but every time I come back to Seattle, this is a must. Cozy and delicious. Chicken Piccata
fresh lemon, capers, sweet butter - my personal favourite with a side of spaghetti. Oh man. I need to get back up there! Well done you."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Elizabeth K.,"I absolutely loved my meal here! I was in the mood for a more basic pasta dish, something like plain spaghetti with marinara, and Machiavelli offered that. However, I was delighted to end up enjoying the red pepper pasta. It was creamy and full of flavor - perhaps the best pasta I've ever had. After my first bite, I thought, ""can I come here again tomorrow?"" I also got the mixed greens salad, which was served with a great dressing.
The restaurant was busy, but the wait staff was attentive and friendly. One of the staff members took some photos of a group that had finished dining, even though the restaurant was pretty busy. I thought that was kind."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Sou M.,"My friend was craving carbs a few nights ago and she loves italian, so we looked this place up and decided to go.
When we got there, there was a 30-40 mins wait time (on a Tuesday). We were waiting at the bar area and asked the server if we can just order food or appetizers at the bar and she said we can do that. The bartender, however, denied to take our food order or even showing us the menu!
After finally getting the table, we ordered an eggplant parmesan and a penne pasta with red pepper and walnut. They served complementary olive bread with a mix of olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette which we loved!
The eggplant parmesan was just ok, it was too cheesy and not as breaded as we like. The pasta was really good and creamy.
The server was nice and attentive. The ambience is old and cosy, with dim lighting. The wait time for food was long. The value for price is good since the portions are big."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Pinky P.,"This place was recommended to us by family who lives close by. And thank heaven they did! When we first walked in, I was scared we wouldn't get a table. Always a good sign in my book when a restaurant is packed but even a better sign when it's a random Tuesday night!
The service was incredible from the minute we walked in. Everyone was so friendly.
We ordered the chicken parmigiana and the spinach ravioli. The ravioli was delicious and they didn't skimp on the tomato cream sauce. Pretty delicious. The chicken parmigiana blew our minds! We both decided it was by far THE BEST we have ever had! The sauce was so perfect and the chicken portion was perfect. Usually it's too thick and you loose the flavors eating the chicken.
Last we had the chocolate mousse tiramisu. It was also good. I preferred the moose over the rum dipped lady fingers.
The only slight improvement would be the bread in the beginning (which was complimentary). It was really hard and chewy but really does not matter with everything else being so amazing! Go eat the chicken parm here! You won't regret it!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Phil G.,"A week ago, we were told Tavolata wouldn't do take out. I phoned tonight, 3/13/2020, and sure enough, Tavolàta was happy to have us pick up food. We have been on a social distance quarantine since the Coronavirus pandemic erupted. I guess other people aren't reading the same research I am. People were out and about, in spite of the rain, and in spite of any contagious virus. The bars on 2nd Avenue were full, including the bar at Tavolàta. I felt foolish, locking myself inside all week, but then again, my age is susceptible to complications if I contract the Coronavirus. Foolish, paranoid, overly cautious, vigilant, better safe than sorry; who knows?
The food from Tavolàta was good. Our rigatoni and pappardelle pastas were good. The Arancini balls were a bit bland for my taste. Carpaccio was okay. Bread was well baked. Prices were Seattle high - $100 for this meal. Expensive, but there isn't much choice in the Emerald City. This is not an egalitarian city anymore."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Brian B.,"Great service! Great food! Definitely Italy recommend the knoche! My wife and I will definitely be back!
Update: we came back and it was amazing again! Seriously love this place!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Brian B.,Great service! Great food! Definitely Italy recommend the knoche! My wife and I will definitely be back
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Maia R.,"Terribly disappointing experience, and had it not been for our waitress, this would be one star. I had made our reservations the day Valentine's Day reservations opened and the menu posted at Tavolata. Despite our early booking, we were seated in the very center of a communal table (that, as I recall, I had specifically requested to avoid). The table was too loud for me and my boyfriend to even speak to each other, so we requested to be moved to another table. Meanwhile there were several other couples at their own tables, including one couple at a 4-top. They sat us at the bar, which was fine.
Once we were seated at the bar, we reviewed the menu. The menu in our hands had almost entirely different courses for the pasta and entree from what Tavolata had posted online and the menu we had so been looking forward to. This was incredibly disappointing and deceptive in my opinion.
Our waitress at the bar was lovely (blonde curly hair and tall). But the servers left dirty plates on our spot for too long (I had to ask them to clear the appetizer plates) and they did not seem appropriately trained. I overheard one server saying it was his third day at the job, and the hosts (we were sitting directly next to them) were cursing and mocking some of the patrons to each other by the end of our dinner.
Also, our ticket for our 2nd and 3rd courses ""got lost."" We waited over 1.5 hours for our pasta course after getting the appetizers. When our waitress told us this, she was apologetic but didn't offer any recourse until I asked her if we could have more wine since we had drank the glass that was supposed to be paired with our course. She was happy to oblige but it was pretty clear all we would have gotten was an apology otherwise. When we finally got our pasta, it was cold.
The food was okay. Porchetta was way too salty with huge salt crystals and peppercorns intact that made a difficult texture to chew. If they had had their promised menu I would have ordered the lobster (by the way, Tavolata, don't promise this as a menu item if you aren't positive you'll get it. We had thought about going to the lobster dinner at Derby but didn't because we saw we would get lobster on this menu. What a waste.) Mushroom ravioli was okay but not what I was looking forward to going into the meal. Port wine pairing was cheap and too sweet. 2.5 hours later we left our meal feeling unsatisfied and disappointed.
I've had quite a few experiences with Tavolata before this, but after being so disappointed with this deceptive and uncomfortable experience, I will never be returning."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Zachary H.,"My gf and I went here for our anniversary.
We were hoping to get the happy hour deals but the bar was full so we sat at a table. It's a bit annoying that the happy hour is only offered at the bar and not at the tables. If I sat 3 feet away from my table seat my dinner would've been deeply discounted for the same food. Oh well.
Upon being seated, the waiter gave us each a small glass of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary. That was a kind gesture and was appreciated. We ordered some drinks and our meals and waited in anticipation. I ordered the pappardelle and my gf got a carbonara dish. The food was stellar. When it arrived at the table it was one of those dishes that doesn't look like a lot of food until you start eating it. We also ordered the bruschetta with smoked salmon. It was tasty but I'd probably try another appetizer next time.
The service was exceptional and food was awesome. I hope to return at some point and hopefully get a spot at the bar for happy hour!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Kamara S.,"Out of all the Italian restaurants I visited in Seattle, I have to say Tavolàta is one of my faves.
I have been to both restaurants multiple times. In fact, once I came an hour early because I thought it opened at an earlier time. Of course, I couldn't show my face for a period of time after that.
This review is for the Belltown location. The people there are friendly as you walked through the door and explain to you that happy hour (5-7 pm) is limited to the long bar in the front and the side table structure at the very front of the restaurant. I say structure because it glides along the window in a weird pattern that is aesthetically interesting to see.
I have to say this restaurant has a great happy hour. I define a good happy hour as one where you could get a decent meal just off of ordering from the happy hour listings alone. You can get cheap but delicious wine options ($6 bubbles don't mind if I do). Good apps to share (if you are into that). Plus actual pasta options like 2 different dishes of spaghetti depending on your interest. Plus I appreciate that they have an actual dessert on the happy hour menu as well.
Myself, like many others before me, have chosen the gnocchi alla romana thinking it would be the small ones we know. I won't call it a mistake because I enjoyed the dish, but I think they can call it out more so people know what to expect.
But the main reason I go back to this restaurant, even if I have to cross from the Eastside is for something that isn't even on the menu and isn't available all the time. It is... their bucatini carbonara. I know this is not the first place I had bucatini but it is a good reason why I love it. It is not even available during happy hour but I keep going back for it (I try other good things as well).
The worst part is the guessing game in which you have to see it if it would be available. I could call ahead to check but even I am not that ridiculous and I can try other dishes when I get there. I have been there once where they were going to have it the day after I ate there. I was crushed. But it is a great #treatyourself meal if it is available.
Would I bring a big group to Tavolàta? Not in the winter if you are banking on happy hour. But if we wanted to ball on pasta and other treats, sure. If it was 2-3 people, I would definitely try to get a bar seat. It would be a great and interesting date location.
This was my first Ethan Stowell restaurant when I came to Seattle and it has inspired me to go to more"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Heather W.,"Highly recommend the Pappardelle! Was delicious.
Burrata app, not so much. Their menu changes but it seems they keep different versions of it - when we order it there were figs. Issues were the oddity of the ice cold cheese and rock hard crustinis that are a bit painful to bite into. After enduring for a bit, I decided to ask our server for some fresh bread and that switch helped a bit. If the crustini was a bit thicker cut and more chewy than hard, it would help a lot.
Got 'An appropriate sipper' (bourbon based cocktail) and that was very tasty and enjoyed.
Our table was towards the back along the wall with view into the open kitchen. I always enjoy watching the kitchen prepare meals. Great advertising on their part since it convinced us to get the delicious dessert that was being prepared for a large group. I forgot to take a photo and my memory is fuzzy but since these items change often there isnt much point!
I do appreciate the constantly changing menu; I'm sure this is a popular spot for locals of Seattle. Lovely ambiance, attentive service, delicious italian food."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Michelle A.,Happy hour at Tavolàta is great ! Be warned... you'll need to be first in line with your whole party in order to be seated. The pasta is pretty good. What puts the cherry on top is the fact that the pasta is made from scratch !! How many places can say that ?? Their happy hour brings plates half off and house wines as well. Employees are very friendly and check in on you often to see if you're doing okay. The reason for the 4 star review is because there isn't much seating space around the bar area... which I believe are the only seats available for Happy Hour menu options (could be mistaken). Overall I've come here a couple of times and will continue to do so.
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,David H.,"I really enjoyed having dinner for Seattle Restaurant Week here because they allow you to order anything off of their menu, while most restaurants have a limited menu.
For appetizers, I loved the bruschetta. It was well cooked and the smoked fish was perfect on top. This was probably the only appetizer I enjoyed.
For entrees, we had the rigatoni and the halibut. Right away you can see that the rigatoni comes in a pretty good sized serving. The sauce and meatballs were delicious and had a pleasantly spicy kick to it. I definitely recommend this dish! The halibut was pretty disappointing. It was charred, but a little too charred. Some bites tasted like nothing but char, which was annoying. The rice & sauce that accompanies the halibut was good though. If you're interested in this dish, I'd strongly recommend requesting it to be just lightly charred.
The service here was excellent. Our server gave us a good recommendation for wine and was friendly and attentive all evening long. I've heard that sometimes servers at pricier restaurants can be a little biased against you if you're there for SRW, but they really seem to embrace SRW here.
Overall, Tavolata is not one of my favorites for Italian food but it's still pretty good. Personally, I probably wouldn't come back for anything other than Happy Hour or SRW because there are better affordable options around, but if you decide to come here for dinner it's a solid choice."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Madison S.,"This is my second time to a Tavolàta restaurant. The pasta is pretty dang good. The atmosphere is delightful (think candle light, rustic modern brick, open kitchen). It is rather loud in the restaurant. Can we tough to find good parking, so we paid to park in a lot behind the restaurant. The starter bread was good (not out of this world). The spaghetti dish was really good - noodles were thick and delicious and the sauce was light and yummy. The Pappardelle was good - heavy sauce, orange flavor didn't throw me off a ton, and thick noodles. I preferred the spaghetti dish however because the noodles and sauce were better IMO. The chicken and ricotta meatballs were also very good with the spaghetti. Portions are large - we both took some to go. Price is high.
As a local. I don't think it was worth going again for the price overall, but a nice dining experience for a date night."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Naveed N.,"Yet another Ethan Stowell homerun!
We had reservations for restaurant week- but because I'm a bottomless pit, we figured it wouldn't be enough food and stopping in for happy hour just before would be the right move.
Sat at the bar for happy hour and enjoyed some drinks, and small bites- The baked gnocchi will forever live in my dreams.. truly fantastic.
Dinner/Drinks overall were really great, and I particularly enjoyed the hangar steak they were offering at the time for restaurant week.
It was a bit noisy in the restaurant which made conversation difficult, but I also wasn't expecting a quiet/low-key dining experience so that is okay! I've yet to visit again but plan to fulfill my gnocchi craving very soon. Cheers!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Tara D.,"Food was phenomenal! The duck was amazing, especially the finishing sear. The risotto was creamy and flavorf. Even the starters were great! We ordered the brussel sprouts and squash as well as the bread, and oil and vinegar. Beautiful flavors in everything! I would be happy to come back."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Rebecca W.,"This place has serious date night vibes with the dimmed romantic lighting and with their awesome happy hour you can do date night on a budget! I came to celebrate my friend's birthday recently and the whole experience was amazing! The hostess was super nice and made an exception by letting my two friends sit in the bar area (HH area) before I got there (usually the whole party has to be there). The food tasted amazing at only $12 a plate on the happy hour menu it's a steal!!! They also didn't skimp on the size like I expected for HH and instead the plates were full dinner size. The drink prices were also pretty good with $6 for a well drink and $$4 for a San Juan hard seltzer.
I ordered the spaghetti with chicken ricotta meatballs and I'd give it a 4/5 stars. You can definitely tell the pasta was homemade from the great texture and the sauce was light, but well flavored. I liked the meatballs, but I wish you could taste the ricotta more and that they did 3 slightly smaller meatballs instead of 2 massive ones. I'd definitely order this again! My friend had the Pappardelle and from the one bite I tried I it also tasted really good!
I'm definitely coming back and I highly recommend this place for happy hour (5-7pm)! I might even come back and try the full dinner menu. Thanks for the quality food/drink and I can't wait to come back!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Elly L.,"We had their gnocchetti and pappardelle when we visited Seattle last year. The pastas were al dente and the flavors were very good. I liked the pappardelle flavor a lil more. Gnocchetti's flavor was a lil less than what I expected, but nonetheless it was still good. And they give a generous amount of pasta and sauce.
Next time when I'm in Seattle and is craving for good Italian pasta, I would like to come back here."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Joel Y.,"Deeeelicious! Came here on a Saturday night and even though it was busy, was able to find seating almost right away. The service was great, ambience was superb, and the food was yum.
Ordered the roasted beets which were the best beets I've ever had along with the Pappardelle and the Gnocchi Alla Romana. The food was tasty and wasn't too overfilling which was perfect. Also the drinks where outstanding. Definitely a good place to go if you're in the area."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Emily H.,"Outstanding pasta! A little pricey, but if you're looking for a trendy (possibly intimate) dinner spot and you don't mind paying a little more for your pasta then check it out! I came here with a group of girls for a friend's birthday and we had a great time. Shared the brussels sprouts, they were a little too salty for me but everyone else liked them. For dinner we each got either traditional spaghetti, the butter noodles, or sausage rigatoni. We agreed the rigatoni with the spicy sausage was the best, but the spaghetti was delicious too! The buttered noodles (called something fancier on the menu) were actually pretty good considering it's a rather basic dish. We shared the donuts for dessert and the chocolate sauce they came with was amazing."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Marina K.,Omg the potato gnocchi is the best! Cocktails and service is lovely as well. Great place for family or friend dinner and maybe a first date. We came on a week day around 6pm and got a table no problem but call ahead to make sure they have room. Nice kinda dark ambiance as well. I will def be back!
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Sarah N.,"We stopped in for late night food after our flight landed and we are so Glad we came here. We were hungry, tired, and just need a good meal.
This is true homemade Italian! The ambiance and wait staff and accommodating and amazing. They help with suggestions and are prompt to check on you. The food is so fresh, homemade, and delicious. So many flavors go into each dish that make every bite appreciated.
Wine and beer selection is great - cocktails available too. Would recommend or go back if we have the chance!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Ellen C.,"I forgot how good this place is, having gone to the Cap Hill location. My friends and I stopped by for dinner Friday night at around 8pm and got seated quickly without reservations. I ordered the rigatoni and let me say that the pasta was cooked to perfection. I ate that entire dish as if I've never had pasta in my life.
Highly recommend if you've never tried this restaurant."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Julia P.,"LOVE the happy hour menu!! Super affordable and tasty dishes. My personal favorite is the pappardelle, but everything is also delicious. The bread was fresh and warm and the spices and flavors they use in their pastas really come through. I'm no expert in Italian food but and I can tell this is GOOD Italian food :)
If you decide to come here, definitely try go for the happy hour. The bar does fill up quickly so try to come early. Best to come with 2 people."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Sachi E.,"fun fact: they light every single candle every day!! The ambiance of the restaurant was typical for an Italian restaurant. their food was delicious, my opinion a little over priced - still good tho. Their dessert was my favorite part! Highly recommend their creme brulee :)"
